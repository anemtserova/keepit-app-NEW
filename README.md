# APP IS UNDER RECONSTRUCTION...

# KeepIt.App

This is a simple contact management app that has user authentication through `flask-JWT-extended` and is built with `reactjs`.

The user can add, edit, and delete contacts. Notes can be added and deleted to each contact as well.

The application is using API to store the full contact information with exception to the note which is stored separately in `Local Storage`.
