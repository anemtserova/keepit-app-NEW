# KeepIt.App

This is an easy-to-use full-stack contact management app built with `reactjs` and `Python/Flask`, and `SQLAlchemy`.

The user can add, edit, and delete contacts. Notes can be added and deleted to each contact as well.

The application is using API to store the full contact information with exception to the note which is stored separately in `Local Storage`.
